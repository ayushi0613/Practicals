         courses like M.Sc., M.C.A. and M.B.A. apart from the choice of taking up placements that
       are offered to them by companies that require their expertise as computer science graduates.
       The well qualified and dedicated faculty provides guidance in academics, higher studies,
       research and placement of our students. Exposure to emerging trends and technologies,
       aids us to facilitate growth that strengthens the knowledge base of the students.</p>
